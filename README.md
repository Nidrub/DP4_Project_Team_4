Briefing:
We’re creating an app to help young adults improve their financial skills. Many in this age group struggle with managing money, whether it’s due to student loans, lack of savings, or simply not knowing how to budget effectively. Our app will provide tools for tracking spending, setting savings goals, and managing finances in a way that’s easy to understand. The goal is to help users make smarter financial choices and build healthy habits, so they feel more confident and prepared for the future. For example, with student loan debt at an all-time high and many young adults lacking emergency savings, this app aims to fill an important gap by giving people the financial knowledge they need to succeed.
The app we created is different from others in how it turns financial progress into a rewarding experience. It uses gamification to make money management engaging. Users earn digital rewards, like new avatars or cosmetic upgrades, as they achieve real-life financial goals, such as saving money or opening a savings account. By tying financial milestones to these fun rewards, the app helps users feel a sense of accomplishment for taking control of their finances. It’s all about motivating users to take action in their financial lives, while also keeping the experience fun and engaging. This approach helps make money management feel less intimidating and more like an achievable game, where the rewards aren’t just digital but real and valuable in their lives.
