    <string name="lockedReward1Text"><b>Open a CD savings account</b>\nWhat is a CD Savings Account?\nA CD, or Certificate of Deposit, is a type of savings account that lets you earn more interest on your money than a regular savings account. When you open a CD, you agree to keep your money in the account for a specific period, like 6 months, 1 year, or even 5 years. In return, the bank pays you a higher interest rate, so your money grows faster. However, you can not take out the money during that period without paying a penalty. CDs are a safe way to save if you do not need immediate access to your money and want to earn a bit more.</string>
